Time profiler

---

Implemented a simple profiler named `time-profiler.py` that given a python project, modifies the code to calculate and store the execution time of methods in a file named `exec-time.log` during execution. This file contains name of the methods (including path to .py file) and total elapsed time in milliseconds. Note that a method can be invoked multiple times, therefore the profiler reports the total time the program spent in that method.
